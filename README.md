Cats vs. Dogs Classification using SVM & Deep Feature Extraction 🐱🐶

Overview 🚀
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for classifying images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) enhanced with deep features extracted from a pre-trained VGG16 model. By leveraging the power of deep learning for feature extraction and the efficiency of SVMs for classification, we achieve robust results on the popular Kaggle Cats vs. Dogs dataset.

Project Description 📚
The primary goal of this project is to accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The pipeline comprises the following key steps:

Data Loading & Preprocessing:
Load thousands of images from the dataset, resize them, and apply necessary preprocessing.
Deep Feature Extraction:
Utilize VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet) to extract high-level features from each image.
SVM Training:
Train a linear SVM classifier on the extracted features to perform binary classification.
Evaluation & Visualization:
Evaluate the model's performance with test accuracy metrics and visualize predictions to assess the results.
This approach combines the best of deep learning and classical machine learning, providing a strong baseline for image classification tasks.

Installation & Setup ⚙️
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cats-vs-dogs-svm.git
cd cats-vs-dogs-svm
  ```
Set Up a Virtual Environment:

  ```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
  ```

Install the Required Dependencies:

  ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
Dependencies include TensorFlow, scikit-learn, OpenCV, tqdm, and matplotlib.

Download the Dataset:
Download the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset and extract it to your local machine.
Update the dataset path in the code as needed.

Usage 🖥️
This project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook, which allows you to run and modify each step interactively. The main stages are:

Data Loading & Preprocessing:
Load raw images, apply resizing, and perform VGG16 preprocessing.

Feature Extraction:
Extract deep features using the VGG16 model (without the top classification layers).

Model Training:
Train an SVM classifier on the extracted features. Training progress and time are logged for transparency.

Evaluation & Visualization:
Evaluate the model’s accuracy on the test set and visualize a random sample of predictions with true vs. predicted labels.

Results & Evaluation 📊
After running the complete pipeline, you will observe:

Detailed training logs with elapsed time.
Test accuracy metrics printed to the console.
A set of visualizations displaying sample images with their true and predicted labels.
While a 99% accuracy target is ambitious, the combination of deep feature extraction and SVM can yield competitive results (often in the 90–95% range with further tuning).

Future Improvements 🌟
Possible enhancements for this project include:

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Experiment with different kernels and regularization parameters for the SVM.

Data Augmentation:
Increase dataset variability with augmentation techniques to boost performance.

Fine-Tuning the VGG16 Model:
Perform end-to-end fine-tuning on the dataset for improved feature extraction.

Develop a Web Interface:
Create a simple web application for real-time image classification.
